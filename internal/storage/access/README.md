# Storage Engine (Indexes)

This package implements the storage engines described in Chapter 3, "Storage and Retrieval" of the book "Designing Data-Intensive Applications".

## 1. Hash Indexes

The simplest possible indexing strategy is keeping an in-memory hash map where every key is mapped to a byte offset in the data file

## 2. LSM Tree

## 3. B-Tree (or B+Tree)
